- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sa97480
- 👀 I’m interested I am interested in Deep Learning in geography. Especially on the recognition of endemic plants in the forest from augmented realities. The data must be georeferenced in order to be guided on the course without impacting the natural space for the picking of endemic plants. To do this, I need to use the "Plant.net" application for the recognition of plants, you need the use of a powerful Lidar, a deep view, an effective algorithm and A preparation before performing the work. This system will open a field for other existing technologies currently such as the use of robotics in picker work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python programming, I do a technological watch of all that this currently realizes and I perfection in my discipline, spatial analysis in geography.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on artificial intelligence. Indeed, before being a geographer, I am a farmer in a developed country. I had to stop picking an endemic plant on natural spaces for lack of labor. The system at home is structured in such a way that it no longer encourages anyone to work outside, in the forest. Which threatens my farm. Being disabled at more than 50% after an accident, I can no longer do this work. So as I have a master's degree in geography and I published in nature and other scientific magazines on space ecology, I embark on the AI adventure. I am looking for talented and motivated programmers. I created a startup and I participated in November in an investor movement in Kenya in order to convince investors that we must invest in this project with high technological and economic potential.
